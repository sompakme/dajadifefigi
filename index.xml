The lazy sway of the trees
I saw the look in your eyes looking into the night
Not seeing what you wanted to see.Darling, don't say a word I've already heard
What your body is saying to mine
You're tired of fast moves
You got a slow groove on your mind.
You want a man with a slow hand
You want a lover with an easy touch</description></item><item><title> Electric Light Orchestra Showdown</title><link>/electric-light-orchestra-showdown.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/electric-light-orchestra-showdown.html</guid><description>She cried to the southern wind

One of the reasons why Trader Joe‚Äôs items emerge and depart so regularly is because they‚Äôre said to be obtained from other major companies, and they may only get limited amounts of things packaged under the Trader Joe‚Äôs name.</description></item><item><title>Fake Toll Plaza Cheats Everyone Over 1.5 Years</title><link>/fake-toll-plaza-cheats-everyone-over-1-5-years.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/fake-toll-plaza-cheats-everyone-over-1-5-years.html</guid><description>A fraudulent toll plaza operated by local strongmen on the Bamanbore-Kutch national highway in Gujarat managed to deceive government officials for over a year.
