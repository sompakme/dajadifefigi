I think about my drag elders from back in the day and how strong they were. Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera were pioneers. All those women who stood their ground at Stonewall—they deserve the world. They deserved better than what they got. That’s why we’re here, that’s why we’re queer, that’s why we’re doing what we have to do to make our parents, our elders proud.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As told to Ariana Marsh</p><h2 data-node-id=17 class="body-h2 css-1ooignj emevuu60"><strong>SASHA VELOUR</strong></h2><img alt="life is drag" title="life is drag" width=1500 height=2250 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz080123welldragqueens-005-wm-6491fa55b6ede.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">RYAN McGINLEY</span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="body-dropcap css-udyf5a emevuu60">I struggle with eye makeup, but lipstick is very affirming for me. I like to say that I have always been doing drag; I just didn’t know what it was called. As a little kid, I would dress up and imagine myself performing all the lady roles I would watch in the movies. It helped me find myself.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">My nickname was always Sasha. I got Velour from a little camp sci-fi drag film made in the ’90s called Vegas in Space. As a kid, I hadn’t really realized my drag character yet, but I was drawing a drag alter ego in my comics.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I was always drawn to the kind of alien, beyond-gender look of having absolutely no hair, but the real motivating factor was that my mom lost her hair because of cancer treatment right at the time I started drag. She made some points about how much femininity is tied to having hair. And I thought, “Look at your face and how gorgeous you are and the clothes you wear and the earrings.” She had some interesting feminist concerns about drag, but she didn’t really understand it, which is why we have to make it part of the conversation.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>“The biggest misconception about drag is that it’s a mockery of gender. Even if it’s funny, it’s never a mockery. We’re paying homage to ideas of femininity.”<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">My family—a bunch of loud, fabulous Jewish people who love playing music at full volume and dancing around—always made me feel welcome. But when I was four or five, they warned me that maybe not everyone would be so accepting, and I felt that from a lot of the other kids at school. So I kept that part of myself hidden.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Drag was not available in the ’90s. It wasn’t until I was an adult that I saw it out in the world, finally, in New York—art in the middle of a bar. I was learning about the way drag was an art form, but also about the activists, figures like the great Sylvia Rivera and José Sarria, who were using the attention that came with being in drag to demand equality for physically queer and trans people.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When I started drag, I didn’t think about the audience. I just wanted to feel empowered and beautiful. Now, my motivation is what it does to people. I’ve seen people really come out of their shell by going to drag shows, not to mention doing drag themselves. And I think that’s why conservatives are scared of us. We are asking the world to change, to make room for people to be their full selves.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I’ve seen all kinds of people coming to drag shows and loving it. That’s what’s so at odds with these anti-LGBTQ laws. It’s scary to be met with literal death threats every day, but in the world I do see growing love and acceptance of queer and trans people.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The biggest misconception about drag is this idea that it’s a mockery of gender. Even if it’s funny, it’s never a mockery. We’re paying homage to ideas of femininity. It’s about getting together to form a new love language around gender that feels welcoming and safe. And, I mean, for the people who refuse to see any gray area in the discussion of gender, it’s very hard to understand that.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As told to Rosa Sanchez</p><h2 data-node-id=30 class="body-h2 css-1ooignj emevuu60"><strong>KEVIN AVIANCE</strong></h2><img alt="life is drag" title="life is drag" width=1500 height=2250 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz080123welldragqueens-008-wm-6491fa5a16343.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">RYAN McGINLEY</span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="body-dropcap css-udyf5a emevuu60">Say you’re an introvert or you’re someone who can’t communicate well or someone who sits in the background. Drag has a way of giving you this armor that makes you a warrior. It makes you a sergeant in the army. When you put it on, you feel yourself come together. I feel the most protected when I am in drag.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I was always a performer. I remember being in ballet class and being like, “This is cute, but this is not what I’m feeling.” Voice class, acting class, like, “Oh, this is really not doing it.” Something was missing.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When I started doing drag, I started with hair and breasts and tucking and all that stuff. But when I got rid of all that stuff and made my own drag? It was incredibly freeing. I mean, I was doing the he-she-them-they thing, gender bending, way before it became chic.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>“Drag has a way of giving you this armor that makes you a warrior.

Can you imagine being a Black drag queen now, in this day and age? You have to have some really strong bones or you’ll get shattered. It’s real different when Black billionaire songstress diva Beyoncé recognizes you. [When Renaissance came out], I started listening to the album, and it was giving me goose bumps. And then I heard my voice [Aviance’s ’90s single “Cunty” was sampled on Beyoncé’s “Pure/Honey”] and I passed out. Boom, hit the floor. You have no idea what that feels like when you’re somebody like me, girl. It’s like you’ve been cold this whole time and now you are warm. Her doing this album and putting all these gay Black kids on it—we needed someone to do that so bad for us.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=37 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Cunty is a feeling that’s anointed from God. It comes upon you. Anyone can feel cunty. It’s been the theme for us in our lives, and especially with what we’re going through now. Mind you, I’m older now, and I used to say to myself, “I may not be cunty anymore, but I’m looking for someone to carry on the cunty.” ’Cause that’s what you do: You move, you let somebody else come through. But no, girl. I’m still cunty, bitch.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=38 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As told to Chelsey Sanchez</p><h2 data-node-id=40 class="body-h2 css-1ooignj emevuu60"><strong>PLASTIQUE TIARA</strong></h2><img alt="life is drag" title="life is drag" width=1500 height=2250 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz080123welldragqueens-011-wm-6491fa5c35d57.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">RYAN McGINLEY</span>Tiara’s own bodysuit, gloves, and coat. <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.swarovski.com/en-US/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Swarovski data-vars-ga-product-id=9c8956c9-cf55-4b64-9d76-75ee58710c76 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://www.swarovski.com/en-US/ data-product-url=https://www.swarovski.com/en-US/ data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1525079&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.swarovski.com%2Fen-US%2F" data-affiliate-network='{"afflink_redirect":"/afflink/T5ll/www-swarovski-com-product-not-found-403-https-www-swarovski-com-en-us","site_id":"229d0812-d901-44db-87b0-24674345b9e5","network":{"name":"Skimlinks"}}' data-vars-ga-product-price=$0.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=f0489cc9-18b7-43bb-81ae-228517ae9660 class="body-link product-links css-1xesb7e e1aq0z090">Swarovski</a> earrings and necklace.<p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=42 class="body-dropcap css-udyf5a emevuu60">My favorite part about drag is that I get to be my whole self. I started watching Drag Race when I was 15 or 16 years old. I think the first queen I saw was Jujubee—someone who looked like me, who had my skin. And that really awoke something in me.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=43 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The first drag show I saw was at a local bar in [Dallas] called Station 4. I would go and see the amateur competitions, and then when I was 18, I went to perform. It was the summer I graduated high school. I secretly ordered a costume and a wig on Amazon. I was very, very nervous, but I’m an Aries, so if I decide to do something, I’m going to do it and I’m going to do it right. As soon as I got onstage, everything went blank. I won, and I’ve had the bug ever since.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=44 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I grew up in a very religious, heteronormative Asian family. So when I tried to come out, my parents were not very accepting. It was a breaking point for me. I was like, “Okay, am I gonna be happy, or am I just gonna be in the closet forever?” Doing drag was a way for me to kick myself out the closet, basically. I don’t know if you can be gayer than that.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>“When I started doing drag, it changed my mind about everything I was told was wrong. People were seeing it as art. That made me want to be better.”<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=46 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">And then when I started doing drag, it changed my mind about everything I was told was wrong growing up. I was getting praise; people were seeing it as art. I went to beauty school after high school, and before I was a drag queen I was a hairstylist. And I was an art kid in high school, into photography and video, which is why I started doing TikTok. Drag was kind of just a composite of everything I loved.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=47 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The character of Plastique Tiara came naturally. Although I was introverted as a kid, I was attracted to very extroverted things like doing hair, doing makeup, and performing, and Plastique gave me an outlet to do these things. I don’t think of her as a character; I think she’s just another side of me where I can express all these things, and she happens to be onstage.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=48 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Drag taught me everything that I know about myself. It really opened my eyes to how the world works, the way you carry yourself, the way you express yourself, the confidence you carry throughout every day.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=49 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">And everything that you do in drag is available to you outside of drag. This power that I have as Plastique, the way I can command the stage? I have the same power when I’m out of drag.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=50 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Drag queens have always been on the front line fighting for rights for LGBTQIA+ people. I think that politicians view us as, you know, the strong soldiers. They think if they take us down, then maybe they can take everyone down. But that’s not going to be the case.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=51 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As told to Izzy Grinspan</p><h2 data-node-id=53 class="body-h2 css-1ooignj emevuu60"><strong>MISS FAME</strong></h2><img alt="life is drag" title="life is drag" width=1500 height=1875 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz080123welldragqueens-010-wm-6491fa5ae56e8.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">RYAN McGINLEY</span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=56 class="body-dropcap css-udyf5a emevuu60">I ’m not going to give up on my identity or my self-expression because somebody’s trying to eliminate me.

Sometimes, you’re met with fire when you push back, but we have to stay firm in our truth.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=57 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">My first official drag was around 18 or 19 years old. I entered a competition at this small bar in San Luis Obispo, California. Places like that provided me with my first eyeful of the queer community. I was mesmerized but terrified. I kind of wanted in, but I wasn’t sure; I still was tiptoeing. And look at where I’m at today.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=58 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Curiosity led me to answers within myself: clarity and truth. I got sober at 20, so because I didn’t have liquid courage, I had to face my feelings straight up. Makeup and hair and all the things that us artists do to put ourselves together—that gives us our armor.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>“When you make me uncomfortable, my voice is going to get bigger because I’m not going to let you shrink me.

They were homecoming queens and prom queens. They didn’t even know their power, but I saw it. Then I started to see my own and say, “Well, whatever I’ve been blessed with, I’m going to keep it. I’m going to take care of it. I’m going to continue to advocate for that, and I’m going to be that for others.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=61 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">If I had a little me, I’d be like, “You are amazing. You’re going to make it. You’re worthy.” That dialogue needs to be something that we learn to tell ourselves. We have to find the voice inside of us that says, “You’re good enough.” I take a lot of time to tell myself I’m worthy. And I think that our community needs to continue to tell ourselves that we’re worthy. The world is dimensional. Shouldn’t we all be mindful of that? I love different. Different makes the world pretty, makes it interesting.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=62 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I’m proud and I’m grateful that I’ve found this part of my life, that I leaned in and I didn’t let it be reduced or shrunk to make people comfortable, because that would just be a missed opportunity. We should never reduce ourselves for anyone’s opinion. We should always try to maximize ourselves and project what we are in all stratospheres of our life.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=63 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As told to Nikki Ogunnaike</p><h2 data-node-id=65 class="body-h2 css-1ooignj emevuu60"><strong>SASHA COLBY</strong></h2><img alt="life is drag" title="life is drag" width=2100 height=1316 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz080123welldragqueens-007-wm-6491fa59bb553.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">RYAN McGINLEY</span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=68 class="body-dropcap css-udyf5a emevuu60">Seeing the vastness of the ocean and the depths of the rainforests in Hawaii, it makes you feel like your problems aren’t as big as you make them to be. I always try to practice the aloha spirit when I’m working or meeting new people. It’s very important to me to show the world what it’s like to be raised in Hawaii.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=69 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">My sister introduced me to being ultra girly. She had really pretty clothes that I would dress up in while she was at work. I also had a sister-in-law who was this ultra-feminine woman. She had white marabou-feathered kitten heels with a matching satin robe with the feather trim. I just thought that was everything I wanted to be. She would roller-set her hair with hot rollers, and I still do that to this day. Those were the women in my life who were truly feeling their inner feminine-goddess energy. And I thought, “Well, I’m definitely gravitating toward that more than my brothers doing construction.”</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>“Drag is something that the world needs.

Everyone then was trying to be the ultimate ’90s supermodel; every single drag star looked like Naomi or Cindy or Linda. I think that’s still why I’m enamored with that era. It was the era of glamour, and they had so much body and tits, ha!</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=72 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The first time I went to Miss Continental, I was 21 and I didn’t know what I was doing. My best friend and I were just trying to keep up with the legends. The first time they saw me, it was in the swimsuit category. My best friend said, “Sasha, do what you normally do. Don’t get intimidated. Just act like how we dress up!” And I did. I went out there with no inhibitions. And the crowd went up. At that moment, I thought I could do anything.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=73 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Being able to connect with an audience on that huge of a level while just being yourself was so empowering to me. I thought, “Oh, I can literally do what we’ve been playing around doing for years.” To this day, that’s what I do.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=74 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I think drag is just something that the world needs. We need some fantasy, we need some magic, we need some queer joy to combat what’s really going on in the world. And drag will evolve however the world evolves. Drag will always push the boundaries of people’s conception of gender identity and culture in general. I love this moment that we’re living in, where so many queer people of color are coming together and being celebrated and highlighted. We’re always going to be about inclusivity and about providing magic and a safe space for people who get tossed out by society.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=75 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The anti-gay rhetoric is just insane and to me is another way of being anti-human. Politicians are trying to dehumanize queer people at every opportunity they can. To say that we are grooming people is ridiculous. We are already ostracized, and we have made our own community because of that. Because we’re nurturing and caring for ourselves, that mindset absolutely trickles down to children eventually, where they feel safe enough to be themselves. We’re allowing younger kids to be more accepting of others and of themselves—and that’s what they are really upset about.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=76 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">They remind me of that bully in high school. It’s like, “Girl, you just wanna be in drag too! You’re jealous!” And why wouldn’t they be? Our world is so fabulous and so sparkly.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=77 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As told to Bianca Betancourt</p><h2 data-node-id=79 class="body-h2 css-1ooignj emevuu60"><strong>SERENA TEA</strong></h2><img alt="life is drag" title="life is drag" width=1500 height=2250 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz080123welldragqueens-004-wm-6491fa58a1eb5.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">RYAN McGINLEY</span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=81 class="body-dropcap css-udyf5a emevuu60">​​Drag has taught me that I’m a lot more powerful than I think I am. I’m my biggest critic. I’m very, very hard on myself. But every now and then, I’ll catch a glimpse of myself in the mirror or see a performance video or just have someone come up to me and express how much my drag has helped them, and I’m able to remember why it is I do what I do.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=82 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I was so confused about who I was before I found [the drag community] because I didn’t really have a lot of queer people in my life. My best friend—the only other queer person I knew—passed away when we were 17, and I was really, really lost. I remember just yearning for everyone around me to be queer. And I’ve found that now. My community’s really, really beautiful.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>“It’s therapeutic. Everything just connects and flows.

I’m present in a way that I’ve never felt before, unless I’m performing. It’s therapeutic. Everything just connects and flows.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=85 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I work at a drag brunch spot called Lucky Cheng’s. It’s basically a restaurant under a restaurant in a basement in Times Square, and we get a lot of tourists and a lot of bachelorettes and birthday parties. In the beginning of the show, people are always a little hesitant; I can see that they’re a little uncomfortable. At the end of it, people are asking for pictures, they’re thanking us, they’re saying how they’ve never experienced anything like this. With the political climate right now, it’s so important for people who are not in this New York bubble [and who don’t] have a lot of exposure to queer people to see that we’re just artists. We’re here to help people feel good. We’re here to celebrate life and freedom of expression.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=86 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I also am aware that it’s not really about just drag queens. It’s about the trans community as a whole. It is really hard on my trans brothers and sisters, and I try to be there for them as much as I can.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=87 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">We’ve always been faced with ridicule, and we’ve always found ways out of it, and that makes us stronger.
